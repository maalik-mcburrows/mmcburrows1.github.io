    <h1>About Me: Maalik McBurrows</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Maalik McBurrows, I am 21 years old and was born and raised in Roswell, GA. Since I was a young boy I've been fascinated by technology which is what I believe made this bootcamp such an attractive opportunity. My interests include producing music, surfing the web, going to the beach, exercising, enjoying time with friends and family, and all things sports. I'm very excited to meet and share this experience with all of you!</p>
